# Pokedex

The goal of the project was to create a device which can recognise objects and give information about them. 
It is powered by an external battery, and it can be carried around. It only detects objects when 
instructed to do it (when a button is pressed). 
It keeps a browseable history of all detected objects
<!--- The goal of the project is to create a device which can recognise objects and give you information about them.

## Hardware
- [Raspberry Pi4 Model B 4GB](https://www.hgspot.hr/elektronicki-set-raspberry-pi-4-model-b-8gb-original-starter-kit-8gb-komplet)
- [LCD display 2.4 inch](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Coolwell-Waveshare-General-Resolution-Embedded/dp/B08JCFC69B)
- [Speaker](http://www.elmatis.hr/ProductDetails.aspx?productId=52232)
- [Raspberry Pi camera 8MP V2](https://www.tme.eu/hr/en/details/rpi-camera-v2/accessories-for-embedded-systems/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-camera-8mp-v2/)
- [Amplifier](https://hr.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Adafruit/3006?qs=SV%252B0z0o3NTtodS8r%2Ftqo5A%3D%3D)

## Software
This repository contains code which should be run on the device.
Device needs to have OS set up.
I'd suggest following tutorials from [Q-engineering](https://github.com/Qengineering) for either installing an [OS with preinstalled OpenCV](https://github.com/Qengineering/Install-OpenCV-Raspberry-Pi-64-bits) or simply using their [wheels](https://github.com/Qengineering/Paddle-Raspberry-Pi).

## 3D print
In the repository, there is also a directory with .stl files for 3D printing.
An improvement would be to colour it to red immediately and to make the cylinders wider
